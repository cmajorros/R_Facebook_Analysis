This is the demonstration of how to retrive the information from Facebook. For facebook, it allow developer to retrive the in formation
from public page and the developer account information such as location, lastest checkin place, lastest friend (must be developer friend only)
In this project, I was inspired by a developer name "pablobarbera". Thanks Pablo for a great knowledge. 

In this project, I have done the following tasks;
1) Go to facebook developer and create a project and get temporary access token
2) Retrive the personal data from my account such as location, latest friend, hometown and etc.
3) Retrive the information from the public pages, such as the post that people like most, find the average count per month of the pages and etc.
